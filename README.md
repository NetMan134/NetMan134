## Welcome to my profile!
I'm a tech enthusiast from Poland interested in linux, python, web design, thinkpads, classic trance (music genre), programming (duh), tinkering and other stuff as I discover along the way.
My most notable project by far is probably odrabiamy-telegram, above lemonpopup.

Have a good day!

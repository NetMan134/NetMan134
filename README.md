## Welcome to my profile!
I'm a tech enthusiast from Poland interested in linux, python, web design, thinkpads, and other stuff as I discover along the way.
I like cycling, oldskool house, trance, electronic music, traveling, tinkering
My most notable project by far is probably odrabiamy-telegram but I have experience with front-end web design + I tinker around with python.

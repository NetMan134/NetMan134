## Welcome to my profile!
I'm a tech enthusiast from Poland interested in linux, python, web design, thinkpads, programming (duh), tinkering and other stuff as I discover along the way. Enjoys listenting to house, trance, electronic music in general.
My most notable project by far is probably odrabiamy-telegram but I have some notable experience with front-end web design.

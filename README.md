# Hi! I'm Oskar
I'm a tech enthusiast from Poland  in web dev, JS, python, tinkering and all sorts of computer related shenanigans.
My hobbies include cycling, tinkering,  Linux and hoarding :)
My most notable projects by far are:
* [school tv info](https://tv-showcase.638626.xyz/) (haven't released it on git..., but [here's a pic](https://netman.ovh/tvshowcase.jpg) of it running live in my school :D) 
* [odrabiamy-telegram](https://github.com/netman134/odrabiamy-telegram/) (ON HOLD...)

I have experience with front-end web design (not yet with frameworks), want to develop skills in front-end frameworks the back-end as well!
Python is also a nice language for me, as it's easy to write almost like pseudocode!

Also take a peek at my [gitea](https://git.638626.xyz/)! Most notably on the "tod' account, which I use for The Odin Project related stuff

# Hej, i'm Oskar
I'm a ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± tech enthusiast interested in webdev, python, linux, selfhosting and sorts of electronics related shenanigans

I like cycling, tinkering, trains & public transit, hoarding - essentially interested in a little bit of everything and in nothing properly

I've got some personal experience with front-end web design<br>
I want to develop skills in front-end frameworks and the back-end as well

Also, python is awesome (not ideal, but still), don't let anyone tell you otherwise, easy to get going and easy to write and understand like pseudocode :>

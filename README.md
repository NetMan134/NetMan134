# Hi! I'm Oskar
I'm a tech enthusiast from Poland interested in web dev, JS/TS, python and all sorts of computer (mostly software, but hardware is also neat) related shenanigans.

My hobbies include cycling, tinkering, travelling, and hoarding :)

My most notable projects for now are :
* [school tv info](https://tv-showcase.638626.xyz/) (haven't released it on git..., but [here's a pic](https://netman.ovh/tvshowcase.jpg) of it running live in my school :D, will release it eventually)
* [odrabiamy-telegram](https://github.com/netman134/odrabiamy-telegram/) (ON HOLD...)

I have some personal experience with front-end web design, and now dipped into [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)<br>
I want to develop skills in front-end frameworks and the back-end as well<br>
Python is also a nice language for me, as it's easy to write almost like pseudocode!

Also take a peek at my [gitea](https://git.638626.xyz/explore)! Most notably on the "tod' account, which I use for The Odin Project related stuff
